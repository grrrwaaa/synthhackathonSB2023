# Synthesizer Design Hackathon - Santa Barbara 2023

**Dates:** February 17-20 (Friday-Monday)

**Time:** 10am til afternoon

**Location:** SBCAST, 513 Garden St, Santa Barbara

**Hosts:** Karl Yerkes, Graham Wakefield

We are hosting a local synthesizer design hackathon hosted by MAT, UCSB and SBCAST. It is part of an international project sponsored by [Synthux Academy](https://www.synthux.academy), [Electro Smith](https://www.electro-smith.com), [Cycling`74](https://cycling74.com), and [Arturia](https://www.arturia.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAioifBhAXEiwApzCztux6GyLSWwjfZP6dyDkH2szYwakcfsUeglHFjZN-qWaX-ZYkZYHA4BoCknkQAvD_BwE) with many universities and institutions around the world taking part through January and February. 

Participants make anything from sound art devices to interactive installations to musical instruments, but really the program is open-ended. The only ground rule is that projects must be connected to the theme and one of the prompts provided on the first day.

[Examples of projects from the 2022 event](https://www.synthux.academy/events/hackathon-2022) 

**Who can join the hackathon?** Students or researchers affiliated with the university. There’s no constraints and collaborations are encouraged.

Do I need prior experience? This is an inclusive event that invites participants in any age and background. If you’re interested in sound and design you can join! To make it easier we suggest forming small teams.

**What tools and parts are available?** Thanks to MAT, we have a pool of essential components an interesting sensors to build the projects. We also have five Electro Smith [Daisy](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy) microcontrollers, which can be programmed using C++, Max/MSP's gen~, or Pure Data. We'll be giving an introductory session about the Max/MSP gen~ workflow on the first day. 

**What will happen?** It is a 4-day affair with a modest budget for lunch. You will receive a theme and a set of prompts to choose from on the first day. We can't tell you what they are before the event, but... we like them and it is all very MAT. 

  - Day 1: We will introduce the theme and hackathon, and work through a couple of minimal examples using the hardware available, then you'll dive into brainstorming and designing. You are encouraged to explore human-centered design. 
  - Days 2 and 3 are all about prototyping. By the end of the third day your project should be completed
  - Day 4 is reserved for documenting and submitting the project to the SynthUX competition. 

**Prizes.** Although this is not a contest, some truly amazing companies offered to give away their products to participants, among all the hackathons happening around the world. Here are the prizes:

- 15 participants will receive lifetime licence to Cycling74`s Max & RNBO
- 3 participants will receive a licence to Arturia’s _FX Collection
- 2 selected projects will present at Superbooth Berlin in May 2023

All participants will also receive a PDF copy of the classic but long out of print book "Electronic Music" by Allen Strange, recently [republished through the efforts of Jason Nolan](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jasonnolan/allen-stranges-electronic-music).
